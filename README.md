This document is for people to know more about me and how to work with me :D

# About me

I'm 24 years and from Lima, Peru :D

My story with programming began when I was like 8 years and went to a _*robotics with legos*_ summer course. We used an interface that was like the LEGOs Mindstorm one (draggable blocks). I started to be curious about how all of that technology worked, so I decided that I was going to do something tech related.

In my high school years I learned how to build simple web pages with html, css and js and also how to hack wi-fi networks (just for testing purposes, clearly).

Two years ago, I graduated from Informatics Engineering (it's basically computer science but my college decided to name it that way). In my last years of college I started liking Data Science, Machine Learning, AI and that... I also based my graduate thesis in NLP (Natural Language Processing)!

So after I graduated I worked as a data scientist until July of this year, when I decided to take a personal challenge and go back to my other favorite thing: software developing.

Now I'm a software engineer at [Able](https://www.able.co) and I'm learning a lot, which I love.

## What are some of your personal interests or hobbies?

I like to watch series. When I like one I can binge watch an entire season in a weekend.

I also love playing videogames, I prefer PC rather than console, and actually built my own PC.

Some of my favourites games are:

- God of War (all of them)
- GTA 5
- Uncharted (all of them)
- Dota 2
- Fortnite
- Valorant
- World of Warcraft (currently playing)

## Working with me

I think I'm very easy to work with, I like to get to know the people who I'm working with, learn as much as I can from them and, hopefully, they can learn something from me.

Some qualities that I value in people who I work with are respect, honesty, mettle and commitment.

## Working hours

I'm not a morning person, so when I need to wake up at 7 am I struggle a little. I prefer to wake up at 9 am and start working from 9:30.

Usually, I work from 9:30 to 6:30 _-ish_, but sometimes I stay a little more when it's needed, I don't have problems with that.

## Best way to comunicate with me

I like to communicate via message or calls and I'm always aware of Slack and Gmail, I have them on all my devices so in most cases I won't take too long to respond if it's on my working hours. I would prefer Slack but email is also fine :D

I also tend to eat from 2:00 to 2:30 pm, so maybe I will take a little to respond if you message between that time.

## What is your superpower?

I usually don't say this because I think it makes me look a little superb but I'm a fast learner. I can get the hang of things really fast, being a good listener also helps because I can pick up key points easily and start to look at the literature to learn more :D

## About feedback

I like to receive feedback in any form: verbal, written, doesn't matter as long as it's constructive and will help to my personal/professinal growth

I like to give verbal feedback because I can express myself more in that way
